max-request-size in wt configuration file, /etc/wt/wt_config.xml, is increased to let modules.pcimap upload!! 

-rXX revision does NOT have to exist in lspci -mn, so corrected the code appropriately ;|

- pci_vendors table is case sensitive so any pci.ids update with different cases will update the row..


Known Issues :
- Successive queries of lspci in `Query lspci list` screen repeatedly causes to session restart.. :s
